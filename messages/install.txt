            Thanks for trying out the python-black package!
            ===============================================


`python-black` is an unofficial `black` plugin developed for Sublime Text 4.

The current version can format the currently active `.py` file before saving.

The configuration file used is the same as the official `black`.

**Sublime Text needs to be restarted after installing `python-black`!**
